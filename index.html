        <p class="lead"><strong>Ada, Countless of Lovelace</strong>, the only legitimate child of the poet Lord Byron, and his wife Anne Isabella Milbanke, an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a "computing machine" and the first computer programmer.</p>

      <p><em>Lovelace saw that number could represent entities other than quantity. So once you had a machine for manipulating numbers, if those numbers represented other things, letters, musical notes, then the machine could manipulate symbols of which number was one instance, according to rules.</em></p>

      <h3><strong> Concept of the very first computer program</strong><h3>
      <p>Around the age of 17, Ada met Charles Babbage, a mathematician and inventor of the difference engine, which was meant to perform mathematical calculations.  While doing the translation of Babbage's lesson  Ada not only translated the original French text into English, but also added her own thoughts and ideas on the machine.</p>
        <p>Her notes ended up being three times longer than the original article.</p>
        <p>Ada described how codes could be created for the device to handle letters and symbols along with numbers. She also theorized a method for the engine to repeat a series of instructions, a process known as looping that computer programs use today. Ada also offered up other forward-thinking concepts in the article. For her work, Ada is often considered to be the first computer programmer. Her work was published in 1843, in an English science journal. Ada used only the initials "A.A.L.," for Augusta Ada Lovelace, in the publication.</p>
        <p>Ada died from uterine cancer in London on November 27, 1852. She was buried next to her father, in the graveyard of the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Nottingham, England.</p>
        <h3><strong>Ada's legacy</strong></h3>
        <p>Ada Lovelace's contributions to the field of computer science were not discovered until the 1950s. Her notes were reintroduced to the world by B.V. Bowden, who republished them in Faster Than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines in 1953. Since then, Ada has received many posthumous honors for her work. In 1980, the U.S. Department of Defense named a newly developed computer language "Ada," after Lovelace.<p>
